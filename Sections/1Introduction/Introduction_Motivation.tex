The study of the azimuthal correlations of heavy-flavoured particles and charged particles at the LHC energies provides a way to characterize charm production and fragmentation processes in pp collisions as well as a way to probe our understanding of QCD in the perturbative
regime, accessible in a large kinematic range given the large mass of heavy quarks. Flavour conservation in QCD implies that charm quarks
are always produced as pairs of quarks and anti-quarks. The azimuthal correlations obtained using a meson carrying a heavy quark as trigger particle
with the other charged particles in the same event give the possibility to study the underlying charm production mechanism in detail.  In particular, prompt charm quark-antiquark pair production leads back to back in azimuth at first order in leading-order perturbative-QCD (pQCD). Heavy quarks produced from the splitting of a massless gluon can be rather collimated and may generate sprays of hadrons at small $\Delta\phi$. Finally, for hard-scattering topologies classified as ``flavour-excitation", a charm quark undergoes a hard interaction from an initial splitting ($g\to c\bar{c}$), leading to a big separation in rapidity of the hadrons originating from the antiquark (quark) with respect to the trigger D meson and contribute to a rather flat term to the $\Delta\phi$-correlation distribution.

Heavy-flavour correlation studies in more complex collisional systems, like Pb-Pb, play a crucial role in studying the modification of the fragmentation of charmed jets due to in-medium (or cold nuclear matter, in case of p-Pb collisions) effects, in a similar way as it was done for di-hadron correlation studies in heavy-ion collisions (see for example~\cite{th1,th2}). Furthermore, the recent observation of long range correlations in p-Pb for light flavour hadrons and for heavy-flavour decay electrons ~\cite{ALICEridge}
points to possible collective effects or effects originating from gluon saturation in the initial state. More information could be extracted by the eventual observation of the same effect with D mesons.\\

In the following, we describe the analysis strategy for p-Pb in all its steps, and we describe the list of corrections and the estimation of the systematic uncertainties done. We then present the results of $\Delta\phi$ correlations, and quantitative observable extracted to fits to those distributions, obtained for prompt $D^0$, $D^{+}$ and $D^{*+}$ in different ranges of transverse momentum for the D-meson (trigger particle) and the associated particles.
